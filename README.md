## General info
This repo is executive part of Weather station management system - API is from https://github.com/110kc3/python_weather_api
It requires connected Nova SDS011 and DHT22 (or DHT11) sensor to Raspberry Pi board.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3
* pyserial library 
* Adafruit_DHT library 

## Setup
Application can be set up with the usage of requirements.sh script that installs required programs, libraries 
and sets up autostart of the program at start of the Raspberry Pi.

The listening port is set up on localhost:8082 but it can be changed in station_websocket.py file.

When successfully requested data from the websocket you will get 200 response status code
with "response": "successful",

The server responds to the following endpoints:
```
$ /data - JSON response with station data
$ /agent - user-agent data
```

All setup can be done with below command
```
$ sudo ./requirements.sh
```

requirements.sh script was created in order for the end user to have easier time installing measurement station
Script does bellow things in order: 
- updates your Raspberry Pi software
- installs required libriaries and programs
- sets up autostart of the measurement station server
